# TSK-Score-Exchange-Discord-bot
Treating score goals as tokens where you can raise fund and trade with. Co-Explored &amp; Developed with Gemini 2.5 Pro


## Core Concept

The bot allows users to:
- **Mint** a "goal token" for a specific KovaaK's scenario and score.
- **Fund** the goal through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where community members invest "Auras" (the server currency).
- **Trade** these tokens on an open market with buy and sell orders.
- Earn a permanent **Trophy** if the goal is achieved, or a collectible **Relic** if it fails.

## Current Features (Working Alpha)

*   [x] Ranked weekly Aura allowance (`/weekly`)
*   [x] User profiles with Aura and token balances (`/profile`)
*   [x] Goal minting and ICOs (`/mint`)

## Future Vision & Ideas from Gemini 2.5 Pro

- Implementing the "Endgame": Trophies, Relics, extensions, and concessions.
- Adding DM notifications for trades.
- Creating a leaderboard for the richest traders.
- Exploring community events or prize pools funded by the Exchange's fees.

This project was developed in collaboration with Gemini.

it was slightly too ambitious for now. too much UX and edge case considerations. hopefully we will revisit this in the future. - iyo
